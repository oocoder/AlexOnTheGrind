Blog was generated using jekyll tool.  Current Theme is called [flexible-jekyll](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/flexible-jekyll/) and it was developed by Artem Sheludko 


## Installation:

Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.
