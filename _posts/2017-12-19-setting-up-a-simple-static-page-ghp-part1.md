Producing, owning and branding your content is just the 2017 thing for anybody to-do (** and should be a right as well, but I’ll leave that for another day).   I believe that everyone is creative and unique in their own interesting ways.  Which lends itself to create a channel or a viewport into somebody’s life or character.  This character would rebel against the boredom of the mundane everyday life or the exhaustion of 100 plus channels or just the mere high-quality content that can only be produce by a corporation / studio.  

That said the plethora of platforms along with their pros and cons it’s something to considered.  Not only they can provide a convenient monetary option but also can promote your content on the plus side.  The cons would be license agreements, dark algorithm and building up a platform with no deals.  Also, their mantra can always change from no-ad to maybe some ads to eventually me-too we need ads.   

And now that we lost the FCC battle for equal internet bandwidth, one could imagine that all of these platforms would start to get very creative in their business models.  “I’ll donate a new pair of shoes to Africa, if you become a member for at least 6 months” or “We’ll give you 5% pts for every 30 likes, redeemable after 30,000 pts.”  Lol. 

In conclusion, I think this internet era brings amazing opportunities for the masses.  But as more and more people begins to understand and generate wealth, more and more they carve their piece of the cake.  Using judicial muscle to funnel or retain their profit margins.  In this era, the masses will need to fight and fight hard to maintain this opportunity.
