This is my personal blog. I'm using it as a historical archive, for different tech ideas I happen to think about over time.  Its also my way to "pass it" forward for all the free blogs and StackOverFlow information I learned over the years.  Plus, it serve as something to talk about in an interview.  Because we all know they will scan this information anyways.  


It is by no means, authoritive.  Its base on my limited view of the world and pass experiences. 

And now the legal stuff:
